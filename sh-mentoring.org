* Introduction


 This post is about creating a presentation using hand drawn
 calligraphy, but the content of the presentation is a very good
 outline for training people to become mentors.

There is a /huge/ number of books written on mentoring,


#+begin_quote
If mentoring theory disappoints, it is not for a lack of scholarly
attention or a deficit of published research.  By one accounting (J.
Allen & Johnston, 1997), more than 500 articles on mentoring were
published in management and education literatures during the 10 years
leading up to 1997.

 a lot of them
are little more than self-help books (hey it's trendy!) I found this

The crowd at the registration desk gathers, and now my watch
begins. It shall not end until the end of the sprints.

I shall speak no jargon, feign no surprise, well no actuallys, and
avoid all subtle isms.

I will remember what it was like to be a beginner.

I shall wear no crowns and seek no glory in geeking out with all my
conference mates, and instead will drop anything at a moment's notice
to help any beginner with sympathy, patience and a smile.

I am the mentor in the darkness.

I am the friendly coach in the halls.

I am the dunderinit for new happy programmers.

I pledge my life and honor to the Beginners Watch, for this day, and all the
scheduled conference days to come.
