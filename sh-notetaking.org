#+begin_quote
A thesis represents an investment with an uncertain return, mostly
because its life-changing aspects have to do with process. Maybe itâ€™s
the last time your most harebrained ideas will be taken
seriously. Everyone deserves to feel this way. This is especially true
given the stories from many college campuses about the comparatively
lower number of women, first-generation students, and students of
color who pursue optional thesis work. For these students, part of the
challenge involves taking oneself seriously enough to ask for an
unfamiliar and potentially path-altering kind of mentorship.
