** Introduction

In many respects our greatest challenge is finding and evaluating
potential talent.

First, they have to be /smart/.  Second, they have to /enjoy/ working
on and solving problems which means they don't give up easily.  Third,
they have to be /motivated/.

It's then a matter of helping the student find out what they are good
at and enjoy working on.  Some of this comes down to predisposition,
dev people are very different from ops people.
