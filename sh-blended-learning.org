* Introduction

We're trying to teach 21C skills using a 19C system based on factory
assembly line....

To paraphrase Carol Black; what do we do if a student does a math
problem and they do it perfectly and they do it quickly. Do we praise
them? And she said no, we say, I'm sorry we wasted your time, it was
obviously too easy, let me find something you can learn from.

** Mastery Learning

Mastery learning is the concept of each student working at
their own pace and mastering a topic before moving on.  The
now traditional approach is for everyone in the class to
spend the same amount of time on a topic and move on whether
any individual students have understood the material or not.

More recently, the idea of "Flipped Mastery" gained some
popularity. The term was coined by Jon Bergmann and Aaron
Sams, both chemistry teachers. They suggest an
implementation model for Mastery Learning that is mixed with
flipped classroom. The idea is to use technology to
time-shift the individual instruction and eliminate
whole-class lectures. The students watch online lectures and
move through the content at their own pace. In this way
technology frees up the teachers to individualize the
learning for each student.
